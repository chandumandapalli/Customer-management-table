# Customer-management-table

Due to restrictions on my company laptop, I couldn't share this as a proper GitHub repo. Instead, I've zipped the complete code and shared it with you.

**To run this project:**

1. Download and unzip the file
2. Open the folder in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. If that doesn't work, try: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` OR `npm i --force`
5. Once installed, run `npm start`
6. The project should now be running in your browser

Let me know once it's working!
